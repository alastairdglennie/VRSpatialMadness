# VR Hackathon Project
---

Created as part of the Feburary 2017 Improbable SpatialOS hackathon. 
Note - this is my own personal project, created over a very short period of time with a group of people. The code is of hackathon quality, but demonstrates using SpatialOS with SteamVR 

Cool Things
* The balls you spawn are actually fully authoritative on your client, so you should have a good experience with them!

Issues
* Other player balls will appear jerky - I was unable to fully implement a good distributed physics solution in time

Cool Things I wish I had done
* Adding code to move client authority on physics based upon whoever is closest would be awesome
